# Title -- StockX

## Overview and Origin 
**StockX was founded in 2015/2016 by a notable sneakerhead, John Luber, Dan Gilbert, and Greg Schwartz. StockX is known as the first real time stock market for consumer goods as a 'live marketplace'. Buyers of goods can offer a price and/or make an offer to the Seller and the Seller chooses to accept the highest bid or lowest ask offered. Once the item has been bid on and accepted the product then is shipped to StockX where authenticity is verified and then ships to the Buyer. Stock X offers IPO but not as a traditional IPO, meaning Initial Product Offering where an item is being offered to the public for the first time as a Blind Auction. 
**StockX offers each product with real time analysis of product valuation and current trends showcasing previous sales and what future sales should represent. 

## How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

**StockX was founded on the data from sneaker trading online and public marketplaces known as sneaker conventions. Founder Dan Gilbert was said to become aware of the idea when he saw his son buy and trade sneakers with a quick turnaround making large profit margins.

## How is the company funded? How much funding have they recieved?

**StockX was founded by accepting investors and raising capitol from such people as Eminem, John Buscemi, and other notable people in the apparel business. In it's inception, StockX raised $6 million from Investors in 2017, 2018 raised $44 million, and 2019 raised $110 million. Currently, StockX valuation is $1billion. 

## Business Activities 

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

**StockX goal is to modernize the increasing market of buying and reselling valuable consumer goods in the marketplace. Stock offers real time data of what an item is worth in the current market and tracks the data with graphs and sales data to support the sale or non sale of an exclusive item. 

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

*StockX traditional customer is anyone who has a focus on exclusive sneakers and various luxury goods. The sneaker resell market accounts for roughly $2 billion in revenue. 

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

*StockX uses a trading platform similar to the NYSE where trends of recent and past sales of a particular luxury goods is shared with the consumer for an accurate transaction. StockX makes it's revenue from the fees of the sell like an online broker. 

## Landscape

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

**StockX operates in an E-Commerce industry, buying, selling, and verifying luxury consumer goods.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

**Since the opening of StockX the resell market has been given data to support high prices and drive out counterfeit products. Although counterfeit products are still bought and sold in the market and high prices list daily, StockX offers a rationale for such sales.

* What are the other major companies in this domain?

** StockX primarily operates in a domain of it's own but another domain has entered the space without all the stock market analysis known as GOAT. GOAT offers the consumer to bid/ask a Seller a certain price and the Seller can choose to accept or wait for high offers. 

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

** StockX has catipulted the market into a $2B industry that continues to grow annually with the continuous rise of streetwear.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

** Metrics that showcase StockX's performance are: the once small platform helped transact over $1billion in sales in 2019 while representing traffic from 197 different countries. StockX also outpaced sales of retail luxury sneakers for women by 80%. 

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

 **StockX is in a domain all by itself with no known notable competition. GOAT is the closest in the market but differentiates itself by selling new and used merchandise whereas StockX only markets in new deadstock products in the market. 


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

**In my opinion of StockX, I would not incorporate the sale data of similar products sold by Auction Houses as analytical data due to the 'one off' metric. These items are one of a kind and do not accurately reflect the public marketplace being supremely specialized. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

** I think this would benefit the service giving the consumer a more accurate data set of what the marketplace is willing to offer for such an item...real cost. This would allow their Seller and Buyer to accurately price an item and create a more fluid transaction. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

** This would use an algorithm that excluded abnormal sales or data or outliers that do not represent the expected data set.
